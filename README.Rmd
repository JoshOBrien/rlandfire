# rlandfire

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

An R package for working with LANDFIRE data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rlandfire from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcknr/rlandfire")
```

## `landfireAPI()`

The `landfireAPI()` function calls the LANDFIRE Product Services (LFPS) API and downloads products with a user specified resolution and projection. The image below shows the relationship between the `landfireAPI()` arguments and the LFPS parameters.

![Comparison of LFPS and \`landfireAPI()\`](img/lfps.png)

### Example

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(rlandfire)

# LFPS Parameters
products <-  c("ASP2020", "ELEV2020", "SLPP2020")
aoi <- c("-123.7835", "41.7534", "-123.6352", "41.8042")
projection <- 6414
resolution <- 90

# R specific arguments
save_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip")

# call API
ncal <- landfireAPI(products, aoi, projection, resolution, path = save_file)
```
